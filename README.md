In 2019, I was denied the opportunity to major in computer science due to the competitive nature of the program in my university, I was lost and and without a direction as I have always dreamt of working in tech.😞 

I was frustrated after graduation as I didnt want to get into a career that I know I wont enjoy. Out of this depressed and hopeless state of mind I decided to just teach my self everything with the goal of becoming a software engineer.✨
